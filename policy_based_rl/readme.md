# Policy Based Reinforcement Learning

## Introduction 

### Simple Optimization Methods

### Gradience Based Methods i.e Policy Gradient Methods

- REINFORCE
    - This algorithm works by directly looking for the optimal policy by collecting a number of sample trajectories (state, action, reward) then computing the gradient and optimizing via gradient ascent.
